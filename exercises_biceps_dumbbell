========================
Here are the best dumbbell bicep exercises, grouped by what part of the biceps they target (long head, short head, and brachialis). These can all be done at home or in the gym.

💪 Top Dumbbell Bicep Exercises
🔵 1. Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standard)

Palms facing up.

Curl slowly and squeeze at the top.
Targets: Overall biceps

🔵 2. Alternating Dumbbell Curl

Curl one arm at a time.

Allows better focus and reduces cheating.
Targets: Overall biceps

🔵 3. Hammer Curl

Palms facing each other (neutral grip).

Great for adding thickness.
Targets: Brachialis + forearms

🔵 4. Incline Dumbbell Curl

Sit on an incline bench (30–45°).

Arms hang behind you for a big stretch.
Targets: Long head (gives peak)

🔵 5. Concentration Curl

Sit and curl with elbow braced on inner thigh.

Very strict, isolates the bicep.
Targets: Short head (inner bicep)

🔵 6. Supinating Dumbbell Curl

Start neutral → rotate wrist outward as you curl.
Targets: Long head + supination strength
(This is how you maximize bicep activation.)

🔵 7. Zottman Curl

Curl up normal → rotate palms down on the way down.
Targets: Biceps + forearms
(Great for balanced arm development.)

🔵 8. Cross-Body Hammer Curl

Curl across the torso toward the opposite shoulder.
Targets: Brachialis (excellent shape-builder)

🔵 9. Drag Curl

Pull elbows back and drag the dumbbells up your torso.

Less shoulder involvement.
Targets: Short head, upper biceps thickness

🔵 10. Spider Curl

Lie face down on an incline bench and curl straight down.
Targets: Peak contraction, long head
